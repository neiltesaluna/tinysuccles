## How to take care of your succulent

### Watering
Lightly spray directly on to the soil, enough to soak the surface. Wait until the soil is completely dry before you water again.
This usually takes every 2-3 weeks during colder weather and 1-2 weeks during warmer weathers.

### Sunlight
Succulents love the light. If possible, get your succulents a few hours of sunlight in a day and position them in a warmer spot.

### Give it lots of love
The most important rule of all is to have fun with your new companion. Look after it and it will look good for you in return. Make sure not to stress out, after all, gardening is supposed to be therapeutic.
